# GIS/Spatial Resources
This is a list of GIS resources for beginners in spatial data processing. It is designed as a handout or link to be used in courses. It is not comprehensive (how could it be?) but is meant to give readers starting points for many different topics and an overview of some of the places and technology they can use in their work. URLs are included at the end of each item so it is useful in print as well as electronically.

## General
* [GIS StackExchange](http://gis.stackexchange.com) – a GIS Q&A community (http://gis.stackexchange.com)
*	[GeoNet](https://geonet.esri.com/welcome) – Esri’s GIS Q&A, news, and discussion community (https://geonet.esri.com/welcome)
* [Projfinder](http://projfinder.com/) - for when you have data in an unknown projection. Put a coordinate you have into the boxes, move the map to the approximate location of that coordinate, then click the button to see a list of the most likely projections (http://projfinder.com/).

## Tools and their help sites
### ArcGIS
* [ArcGIS Pro Help](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/help/main/welcome-to-the-arcgis-pro-app-help.htm) (https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/help/main/welcome-to-the-arcgis-pro-app-help.htm)
* [ArcMap Help](https://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/latest/get-started/main/get-started-with-arcmap.htm) - searching for tools and keywords here is important since they no longer have a full directory of topics listed (https://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/latest/get-started/main/get-started-with-arcmap.htm)
* [Help for old versions of ArcGIS (10.2 and earlier)](https://resources.arcgis.com/en/help/) (https://resources.arcgis.com/en/help/)
* [Esri Support](https://support.esri.com/en/) - often not useful for users at large institutions who will need to access support from their employer. (https://support.esri.com/en/)

### FOSS GIS

### Web GIS
There are numerous web GIS platforms depending on your needs. They are typically either freemium (small free tier, with payment for more features), paid, or require you to host your own data.

* [ArcGIS Online](https://arcgis.com)
* [MapBox](https://mapbox.com)
* [Carto](https://carto.com)
* 
* [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com) - a simple and fast free/open source library for building web maps (https://leafletjs.com)
* [OpenLayers](https://openlayers.org/) - a free and open source library for building web maps
* [QGIS Leaflet plugin](https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/qgis2web/) - A QGIS plugin for exporting your project as a web map that can be hosted on a standard web server (https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/qgis2web/)

### Other GIS Packages
* [Google Earth Engine](https://earthengine.google.com) (not the same as Google Earth). A platform for rapid, distributed storage, processing, and classification of imagery data. (https://earthengine.google.com)
* [PostGIS](https://postgis.net/) - Spatial extensions for the top free and open source database (https://postgis.net/)
* [OGR/GDAL](https://www.osgeo.org/projects/gdal/) - GDAL is the Geospatial Data Abstraction Layer - its functionality underlies many other GIS packages, but it can be accessed directly from the command line (https://www.osgeo.org/projects/gdal/)
* [GRASS](https://grass.osgeo.org/) - GRASS is a longstanding and foundation GIS package that provides a set of data manipulation and analysis functions and simple GUI
* [gvSig]
* [Manifold]
* [MapWindow]
* [Whitebox Tools](https://github.com/jblindsay/whitebox-tools) (https://github.com/jblindsay/whitebox-tools)

## Projections
### Utilities
* [Projfinder](http://projfinder.com/) - Projfinder helps you figure out which coordinate system your data are in when it is unknown. You type in a set of coordinates and then move the map to the location those coordinates represent and it gives you a list of the most likely coordinate systems for it. (http://projfinder.com/)

### Understanding Projections
* [The True Size](https://thetruesize.com/) - Visualize the distortion of projections by moving countries around the map (https://thetruesize.com/)
* [Map Projection Transitions](https://www.jasondavies.com/maps/transition/) - Watch the map change between different projections to see how each one distorts the Earth (https://www.jasondavies.com/maps/transition/)
* [Spheres, Cones, and Cylinders] (https://mathigon.org/course/circles/spheres-cones-cylinders#sphere-maps) - Move a square around the map and then see the shape  that the square would be on a spherical globe (https://mathigon.org/course/circles/spheres-cones-cylinders#sphere-maps)

## Cartography and Design

## Communities, News, and Blogs
One of the best ways to keep learning is to get involved in communities that deal with spatial information. Here are a few communities and news sources you might find useful.

* The Spatial Community
* #gischat hashtag on Twitter

## Data Sources and Portals
* [Google Dataset Search](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/) (https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/)
* [Openstreetmap (OSM)](https://openstreetmap.org) - Massive source of public and publically-edited spatial data worldwide including roads, paths, neighborhoods, business, parks, boundaries, structures, and more (https://openstreetmap.org).

## Utilities
This section houses links to tools that aren't particularly limited to spatial work, but that people who regularly use computers and spatial data will find useful, including backups, synchronization tools, screenshot utilities, etc. Some will be free and others paid. None are required, but they may prove useful for spatial work.

It starts off with **backup software**. If you work with data, you should have a good offsite backup (not just to an external drive, though that's better than nothing). If you can afford the options listed here, I've used them both and they're highly recommended. Importantly, they're versioned, which means you can roll folders back in time (similar to Apple's Time Machine) and can help you resolve data corruption issues. Please, please, make sure you have a backup if you're reading this!

### Multi-platform
* [Backblaze](https://www.backblaze.com/) Backup - simple and reasonably priced backup software for Windows and Mac. Your backup is versioned so it helps protect you from data corruption and ransomware. Great if you only have one device to back up and includes unlimited storage (https://www.backblaze.com/ - paid).
* [iDrive](https://www.idrive.com/) Backup - another backup option supporting PCs/Macs/mobile devices. You pay for an amount of storage space and can back up many devices into it, making it a nice alternative backup for people with multiple computers. Backup is also versioned (https://www.idrive.com/ - paid)
* [Beyond Compare](https://scootersoftware.com/) - a file and directory comparison tool for Windows, Mac, and Linux. Great for when you have multiple versions of a project laying around and you're wondering "what's different?" between them. (https://scootersoftware.com/ - one time payment, free trial available)

### Windows
* Greenshot (Windows screenshot utility)
* 7zip - simple, free windows archive utility that handles all major formats with no fuss
* Notepad++ - useful windows text editor
* Foxit PDF reader

### Mac

### Linux
