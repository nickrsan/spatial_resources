# GIS/Spatial Resources
This is a list of GIS resources for beginners in spatial data processing. It is designed as a handout or link to be used in courses. It is not comprehensive (how could it be?) but is meant to give readers starting points for many different topics and an overview of some of the places and technology they can use in their work. URLs are included at the end of each item so it is useful in print as well as electronically.

## General
* [GIS StackExchange](http://gis.stackexchange.com) – a GIS Q&A community (http://gis.stackexchange.com)
*	[GeoNet](https://geonet.esri.com/welcome) – Esri’s GIS Q&A, news, and discussion community (https://geonet.esri.com/welcome)
* [Projfinder](http://projfinder.com/) - for when you have data in an unknown projection. Put a coordinate you have into the boxes, move the map to the approximate location of that coordinate, then click the button to see a list of the most likely projections (http://projfinder.com/).

## Tools and their help sites
### ArcGIS
* [ArcGIS Pro Help](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/help/main/welcome-to-the-arcgis-pro-app-help.htm) (https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/help/main/welcome-to-the-arcgis-pro-app-help.htm)
* [ArcMap Help](https://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/latest/get-started/main/get-started-with-arcmap.htm) - searching for tools and keywords here is important since they no longer have a full directory of topics listed (https://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/latest/get-started/main/get-started-with-arcmap.htm)
* [Help for old versions of ArcGIS (10.2 and earlier)](https://resources.arcgis.com/en/help/) (https://resources.arcgis.com/en/help/)
* [Esri Support](https://support.esri.com/en/) - often not useful for users at large institutions who will need to access support from their employer. (https://support.esri.com/en/)
