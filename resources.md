# GIS/Spatial Resources
This is a list of GIS resources for beginners in spatial data processing. It is designed as a handout or link to be used in courses. It is not comprehensive (how could it be?) but is meant to give readers starting points for many different topics and an overview of some of the places and technology they can use in their work. URLs are included at the end of each item so it is useful in print as well as electronically.

## Tools and their help sites
### ArcGIS
* [ArcGIS Pro Help](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/help/main/welcome-to-the-arcgis-pro-app-help.htm) (https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/help/main/welcome-to-the-arcgis-pro-app-help.htm)
* [ArcMap Help](https://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/latest/get-started/main/get-started-with-arcmap.htm) - searching for tools and keywords here is important since they no longer have a full directory of topics listed (https://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/latest/get-started/main/get-started-with-arcmap.htm)
* [Help for old versions of ArcGIS (10.2 and earlier)](https://resources.arcgis.com/en/help/) (https://resources.arcgis.com/en/help/)
